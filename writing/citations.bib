The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

Instead it trains directly on monolingual data and extracts a bilingual signal from a smaller set of raw-text sentence-aligned data. This is achieved using a novel sampled bag-of-words cross-lingual objective, which is used to regularize two noise-contrastive language models for efficient cross-lingual feature learning. We show that bilingual embeddings learned using the proposed model outperform state-of-the-art methods on a cross-lingual document classification task as well as a lexical translation task on {WMT}11 data.},

Their appeal is that they can help alleviate data sparsity problems common to supervised learning. Methods for inducing these representations require only unlabeled language data, which are plentiful for many natural languages. In this work, we induce distributed representations for a pair of languages jointly. We treat it as a multitask learning problem where each task corresponds to a single word, and task relatedness is derived from co-occurrence statistics in bilingual parallel data. These representations can be used for a number of crosslingual learning tasks, where a learner can be trained on annotations present in one language and applied to test data in another. We show that our representations are informative by using them for crosslingual document classification, where classifiers trained on these representations substantially outperform strong baselines (e.g. machine translation) when applied to a new language.},

Our models leverage parallel data and learn to strongly align the embeddings of semantically equivalent sentences, while maintaining sufficient distance between those of dissimilar sentences. The models do not rely on word alignments or any syntactic information and are successfully applied to a number of diverse languages. We extend our approach to learn semantic representations at the document level, too. We evaluate these models on two cross-lingual document classification tasks, outperforming the prior state of the art. Through qualitative analysis and the study of pivoting effects we demonstrate that our representations are semantically plausible and can capture semantic relationships across languages without parallel data.},

	abstract = {Translated bi-texts contain complementary language cues, and previous work on Named Entity Recognition ({NER}) has demonstrated improvements in performance over monolingual taggers by promoting agreement of tagging decisions between the two languages. However, most previous approaches to bilingual tagging assume word alignments are given as fixed input, which can cause cascading errors. We observe that {NER} label information can be used to correct alignment mistakes, and present a graphical model that performs bilingual {NER} tagging jointly with word alignment, by combining two monolingual tagging models with two unidirectional alignment models. We introduce additional cross-lingual edge factors that encourage agreements between tagging and alignment decisions. We design a dual decomposition inference algorithm to perform joint decoding over the combined alignment and {NER} output space. Experiments on the {OntoNotes} dataset demonstrate that our method yields significant improvements in both {NER} and word alignment over state-of-the-art monolingual baselines.},

	abstract = {As the universe of knowledge and subjects change over time, indexing languages like classification schemes, accommodate that change by restructuring. Restructuring indexing languages affects indexer and cataloguer work. Subjects may split or lump together. They may disappear only to reappear later. And new subjects may emerge that were assumed to be already present, but not clearly articulated (Miksa, 1998). In this context we have the complex relationship between the indexing language, the text being described, and the already described collection (Tennis, 2007). It is possible to imagine indexers placing a document into an outdated class, because it is the one they have already used for their collection. However, doing this erases the semantics in the present indexing language. Given this range of choice in the context of indexing language change, the question arises, what does this look like in practice? How often does this occur? Further, what does this phenomenon tell us about subjects in indexing languages? Does the practice we observe in the reaction to indexing language change provide us evidence of conceptual models of subjects and subject creation? If it is incomplete, but gets us close, what evidence do we still require?},

While studies of information seeking and use have been more widely associated with information retrieval, they can make an important contribution to domain analysis, and perhaps help integrate the two approaches. Because of the mutable and overlapping nature of discourse communities and the knowledge they produce, the most operative user studies will demarcate user groups based on the conceptual requirements of the information problem under investigation, rather than by domain. As our understanding of information use develops, models can then be constructed that represent the dimensions of use for specific domains and that take into account relationships between domains.},

	abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

Using semantic and contextual relation in a distributed and unsupervised framework, word2vec learns a low dimensional embedding for each vocabulary entry. Using such a framework, we devise a query expansion technique, where related terms to a query are obtained by K-nearest neighbor approach. We explore the performance of the {AQE} methods, with and without feedback query expansion, and a variant of simple K-nearest neighbor in the proposed framework. Experiments on standard {TREC} ad-hoc data (Disk 4, 5 with query sets 301-450, 601-700) and web data ({WT}10G data with query set 451-550) shows significant improvement over standard term-overlapping based retrieval methods. However the proposed method fails to achieve comparable performance with statistical co-occurrence based feedback method such as {RM}3. We have also found that the word2vec based query expansion methods perform similarly with and without any feedback information.},

	abstract = {Any ontological theory commits us to accept and classify a number of phenomena in a more or less specific way – and vice versa: a classification tends to reveal the theoretical outlook of its creator. Objects and their descriptions and relations are not just “given” but determined by theories. Knowledge is fallible and consensus is rare. By implication, knowledge organization has to consider different theories/views and their foundations. Bibliographical classifications depend on subject knowledge and on the same theories as corresponding scientific and scholarly classifications. Some classifications are based on logical distinctions, others on empirical examinations, and some on mappings of common ancestors or on establishing functional criteria. To evaluate a classification is to involve oneself in the research which has produced the given classification. Because research is always based more or less on specific epistemological ideals (e.g. empiricism, rationalism, historicism or pragmatism), the evaluation of classification includes the evaluation of the epistemological foundations of the research on which given classifications have been based. The field of knowledge organization itself is based on different approaches and traditions such as user-based and cognitive views, facet-analytical views, numeric taxonomic approaches, bibliometrics and domain-analytic approaches. These approaches and traditions are again connected to epistemological views, which have to be considered. Only the domain-analytic view is fully committed to exploring knowledge organization in the light of subject knowledge and substantial scholarly theories.},

	abstract = {Machine learning -- programming computers to learn from data -- has spread across scientific disciplines, media, entertainment, and government. Medical research, autonomous vehicles, credit transaction processing, computer gaming, recommendation systems, finance, surveillance, and robotics use machine learning. Machine learning devices (sometimes understood as scientific models, sometimes as operational algorithms) anchor the field of data science. They have also become mundane mechanisms deeply embedded in a variety of systems and gadgets. In contexts from the everyday to the esoteric, machine learning is said to transform the nature of knowledge. In this book, Adrian Mackenzie investigates whether machine learning also transforms the practice of critical thinking.Mackenzie focuses on machine learners -- either humans and machines or human-machine relations -- situated among settings, data, and devices. The settings range from {fMRI} to Facebook; the data anything from cat images to {DNA} sequences; the devices include neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees. He examines specific learning algorithms -- writing code and writing about code -- and develops an archaeology of operations that, following Foucault, views machine learning as a form of knowledge production and a strategy of power. Exploring layers of abstraction, data infrastructures, coding practices, diagrams, mathematical formalisms, and the social organization of machine learning, Mackenzie traces the mostly invisible architecture of one of the central zones of contemporary technological cultures.Mackenzie's account of machine learning locates places in which a sense of agency can take root. His archaeology of the operational formation of machine learning does not unearth the footprint of a strategic monolith but reveals the local tributaries of force that feed into the generalization and plurality of the field.},

	doi = {10.1109/IALP.2016.7875974},
	abstract = {In this study, we outline a potential problem in normalising texts that are based on a modified version of the Arabic alphabet. One of the main resources available for processing resource-scarce languages is raw text collected from the Internet. Many less-resourced languages, such as Kurdish, Farsi, Urdu, Pashtu, etc., use a modified version of the Arabic writing system. Many characters in harvested data from the Internet may have exactly the same form but encoded with different Unicode values (ambiguous characters). The existence of ambiguous characters in words leads to word duplication, thus it is important to identify and unify ambiguous characters during the normalisation stage. Here, we demonstrate cases related to ambiguous Kurdish and Farsi characters and propose a semi-automatic approach to identifying and unifying them.},

	abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from 19th century and marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed Federalist Papers. During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this paper, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},

Though these approaches perform well in identifying copied or even modiﬁed passages, they assume a closed world: a reference collection must be given against which a plagiarized document can be compared. This raises the question whether plagiarized passages within a document can be detected automatically if no reference is given, e. g. if the plagiarized passages stem from a book that is not available in digital form. We call this problem class intrinsic plagiarism detection. The paper is devoted to this problem class; it shows that it is possible to identify potentially plagiarized passages by analyzing a single document with respect to variations in writing style.},

Currently most descriptions of corpora are textual, and questions such as ‘what sort of a corpus is this?’, or ‘how does this corpus compare to that?’ can only be answered impressionistically. This paper considers various ways in which different corpora can be compared more objectively. First we address the issue, ‘which words are particularly characteristic of a corpus?’, reviewing and critiquing the statistical methods which have been applied to the question and proposing the use of the Mann-Whitney ranks test. Results of two corpus comparisons using the ranks test are presented. Then, we consider measures for corpus similarity. After discussing limitations of the idea of corpus similarity, we present a method for evaluating corpus similarity measures. We consider several measures and establish that a χ2-based one performs best. All methods considered in this paper are based on word and ngram frequencies; the strategy is defended.},

The main emphasis of that paper was not on the new procedure but on the broader consequences of our increasing sophistication in making such comparisons and the increasing (although never absolute) reliability of our inferences about authorship. My present objects, accordingly, are to give a more complete account of the procedure itself; to report the outcome of an extensive set of trials; and to consider the strengths and limitations of the new procedure. The procedure offers a simple but comparatively accurate addition to our current methods of distinguishing the most likely author of texts exceeding about 1,500 words in length. It is of even greater value as a method of reducing the ﬁeld of likely candidates for texts of as little as 100 words in length. Not unexpectedly, it works least well with texts of a genre uncharacteristic of their author and, in one case, with texts far separated in time across a long literary career. Its possible use for other classiﬁcatory tasks has not yet been investigated.},

	abstract = {Co-{PIs}: Matthew Thomas Miller (University of Maryland, College Park), Maxim G. Romanov (University of Vienna), Sarah Bowen Savant (Aga Khan University—{ISMC}, London). Open Islamicate Texts Initiative ({OpenITI}, see https://openiti.github.io/) is a multi-institutional effort to construct the first machine-actionable scholarly corpus of premodern Islamicate texts. Led by researchers at the Aga Khan University ({AKU}), University of Vienna ({UV}), Leipzig University ({LU}), and the Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland (College Park) and an interdisciplinary advisory board of leading digital humanists and Islamic, Persian, and Arabic studies scholars, {OpenITI} aims to provide the essential textual infrastructure in Arabic, Persian and other Islamicate languages for new forms of textual analysis and digital scholarship. In the process, {OpenITI} will enable new synergies between Digital Humanities and the inter-related Islamicate fields of Islamic, Persian, and Arabic Studies. In addition to support from the researchers’ home institutions, it is supported by funding from the European Research Council and the Qatar National Library. Currently, {OpenITI} contains almost exclusively Arabic texts, which were first assembled into a corpus within the {OpenArabic} project, developed first at Tufts University (at The Perseus Project, 2013–2015) and then at Leipzig University (at the Alexander von Humboldt Chair for Digital Humanities, 2015–2017)—in both cases with the support and under the patronage of Prof. Gregory Crane. The much more limited number of Persian texts were compiled during 2015-2016 in the Persian Digital Library ({PDL}) pilot (see: https://persdigumd.github.io/{PDL}/) at Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland. These texts have not been made fully compatible with {OpenITI} {mARkdown} yet and will be made fully available in next releases. Note on Release Numbering: Version 2019.1.1—where 2019 is the year of the release, the first dotted number—.1—is the ordinal release number in 2019, and the second dotted number—.1—is the overall release number; the first dotted number will reset every year, while the second one will continue on increasing.

Support vector machine and random forest were used to establish the classification models for author differentiation. Based on comparative study of classification results of different models, we conclude that the combination of word-final tones motifs, segment-final motifs and word length motifs provides the best outcome and hence is the best model.},

On the tasks of Machine Translation and {POS} tagging, we found these methods to achieve close to, and occasionally surpass state-of-the-art performance. In our analysis, we show that a neural machine translation system is sensitive to the ratio of source and target tokens, and a ratio close to 1 or greater, gives optimal performance.},
