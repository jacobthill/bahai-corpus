# Introduction
This repository contains a number of texts related to the Bahá'í Faith. The majority of the texts are authored by the Central Figures of the Bahá'í Faith, but significant background texts are included as well–texts from the Islamic and Persian literary traditions that are frequently cited in the Bahá'í writings. It is intended as a dataset for use by computational linguists. All of the texts are in Arabic and/or Persian. They are, for the most part, in the language in which the text was originally written, however, translations from Persian to Arabic are also included (as a rule the Bahá'í writings in Arabic are not translated into Persian). These translations are useful for cross-lingual research.

# File Organization and Naming Conventions
Files are organized by 'author' and then 'original' or 'translation'. They end in 'ar.txt' or 'fa.txt' for Arabic and Persian respectively.
